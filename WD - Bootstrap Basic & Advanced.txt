Bootstrap provides two types of containers: .container and .container-fluid.

2 .container-fluid: This is a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport. It adjusts its width dynamically based on the screen size. The content within a .container-fluid element will expand or contract to fill the available space. The .container-fluid class is used for creating containers that are fluid and responsive.

1. JavaScript Migration: Bootstrap 5 has migrated from jQuery to Vanilla JavaScript.

This change reduces the overall file size and dependencies of Bootstrap.

3. Utility API: Bootstrap 5 introduced a new utility API that provides a wide range of utility classes for common tasks, such as spacing, alignment, visibility, and typography. This utility API simplifies the process of applying CSS styles and enables more flexible and efficient customization.

4. Simplified CSS Customization: Bootstrap 5 streamlined its CSS customization approach. It removed the Less preprocessor support and replaced it with Sass, making it easier for developers to customize and extend the framework's styles.

5. Reduced File Size: Bootstrap 5 focused on reducing the overall file size by eliminating unused CSS and removing dependencies on JavaScript libraries. This results in faster page loading times and improved performance.

6. Improved Grid System: While the grid system remains a fundamental feature, Bootstrap 5 introduced new features and classes to enhance its functionality. These include the ability to define column gutters, horizontal and vertical alignment options, and the ability to mix flex and grid layout utilities.

7. Responsive Font Sizes: Bootstrap 5 introduced responsive font sizes using the CSS clamp() function. This allows developers to create typography that automatically adjusts based on the screen size and ensures better readability on different devices.

8.New Components and Utilities: Bootstrap 5 introduced several new components and utilities, including a floating label form component, accordion component, switch component, and more. These additions provide more options and flexibility when building web interfaces.
